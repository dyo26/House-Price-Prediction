# House-Price-Prediction
When buying a house is a problem.. Perhaps you have certain feature to your dream house? But you can't exactly know the price?
Using Machine Learning to help to solve it.
Given published data about house feature and also it's house price. Let's build a model based on that data, and try to predict 
the house price on the test data.

train data contain features and house price. Which is X (for selected features), and y (for house price). Not all features used in this project
test data contain house features only. That is the ML's duty for predicting the house price.
